# DvdLogoBounceGame
 
A small game where you can resize the window to attempt to get the DVD logo to hit the corner of the screen.

Press E to toggle an easy mode that shows the edges of the logo.

Currently there are still some bugs because Unity can't tell when you are resizing the game. But overall it works. 

Took about 3 hours to complete.
